# Smart-Home

Smart-Home is an [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) application where the main component displays room component. It is possible to add new rooms and delete all of them. Also in this app I used routing which helps to navigate between components. If the user uses the wrong path then will be redirected to not found page.

To create this project I used React technology, styled-components [Styled-Components - Main Docs] (https://styled-components.com) and react-icons (react-icons.github.io).This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

Install dependencies using the command below.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Usage

To start the app run the following command.

```bash
yarn start
```

### `yarn start`

The application should be displayed automatically, this is the local address: `http://localhost:300/`
